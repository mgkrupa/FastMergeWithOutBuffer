# FastMergeWithOutBuffer
This project implements a new recursive inplace stable merge function that merges two non-decreasing ranges into one without the use of a buffer. It is compared to the implementation of __merge_without_buffer found in GNU ISO C++ Library and timed to be faster. Three other variants of this function are defined bute the fastest of them is denoted MergeWithOutBuffer().
